- Didn't spend too much time on the TS integration. However I showed that I know how to work with types.

```
type ValueInputProps = {
  value: string;
  onChange: string;
  onBlur: Function;
  onSubmitEditing: Function;
};
```

- Didn't know where to place the back icon looking at the frames. But included the library in the project.
